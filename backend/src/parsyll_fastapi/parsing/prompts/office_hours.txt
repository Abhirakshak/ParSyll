The previous text was taken from a page of a college course syllabus.
For each instructor, return the following information:
instructor's name,  office hours start time with specification of am/pm, office hours end time with specification of am/pm, office hours days of the week, and office hours location(building and room number) in that order separated by commas. 
If there are multiple instructors, seperate the info between two instructors by a ;
If there are multiple days of the week for an instructor then seperate each day of the week by a space. 
If there are multiple start times and end times for an instructor then seperate each start time and end time by spaces.
For days of the week, only return its 3 letter abbreviation
If no information was found for a field (example if the location wasn't found for an instructor) then put 0 for that field

Give only this information, no other wording or explanation please.
